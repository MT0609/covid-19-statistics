                <p>There is no treatment for COVID-19. Medical care can treat most of the symptoms. Antibiotics do not work on viruses.</p>
                <p>Some reports suggest certain drugs, including hydroxychloroquine, can be used to treat COVID-19. No drugs have been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for treating COVID-19.</p>
                <p>Many Australians need medication to manage health conditions. Medication shortages can threaten lives.</p>
                <p>To make sure everyone has access to the medications they need, pharmacies must limit sales of some prescription and over the counter medications.</p>
